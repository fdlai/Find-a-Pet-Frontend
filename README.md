## 🚀 About the Project

### Overview

Find-a-Pet was built to make pet adoption simpler and more user-friendly by connecting people with nearby shelters and rescues.

### Purpose

To demonstrate full-stack development skills, the app uses **sample pet data** generated for development and testing.  
This allows for a fully custom backend with data seeding, authentication, and RESTful API design — rather than relying on external APIs.

### Features

- Real-time search using city or ZIP input with autocomplete suggestions
- Individual pet detail pages with photos and descriptions
- Responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile
- User authentication and persistent favorites list (via backend API)
- Pet searching using different filters: species, breed, sex, age, and size

This repository contains the **frontend**, built with modern React and TypeScript.  
The **backend** (in a separate repo) provides RESTful APIs, data seeding, and authentication with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
